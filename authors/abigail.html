      <p>I have been working in various roles in digital marketing since completing my Masters in 2014 and am currently an Account Manager/Marketing Campaign Coordinator/Chief Humor Expert at a marketing firm in Baltimore. My desire to learn Front End Web Development stemmed from working closely with Web Developers on my team. I wanted the ability to communicate more effectively with them in order to accomplish my client’s goals and understanding the limitations and the possibilities of my developers allowed me to be more creative with my client’s websites, email templates, and landing pages.</p>
